# Spark ADK (AI Development Kit)

**Spark** is a Python AI Development Kit (ADK) for building production-grade AI agents or agentic systems. It uses advanced graph architecture to orchestrate autonomous agents, combining the flexibility of the Actor Model with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Spark goes beyond simple LLM chains or workflows, offering a complete ecosystem for building, observing, and **self-improving** AI applications. With built-in support for resilience policies, telemetry, governance, and recursive self-improvement (RSI), Spark provides enterprise-grade capabilities including distributed state management, checkpointing, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multi-agent coordination—all designed to scale from prototypes to production systems.
