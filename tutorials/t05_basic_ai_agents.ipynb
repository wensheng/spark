    "- Answer questions using different language models\n",

    "**Node** (from Tutorial 1):\n",
    "- Generic processing unit\n",
    "- You define exactly what it does in `process()`\n",
    "- Manual handling of inputs/outputs\n",
    "- Good for data transformation, calculations, workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent** (new in this tutorial):\n",
    "- Specialized for AI/LLM interactions\n",
    "- Handles LLM calls, message formatting, and responses automatically\n",
    "- Built-in support for conversations, tools, and structured output\n",
    "- Ideal for AI assistants, chatbots, and reasoning tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Nodes** for:\n",
    "- Data processing and transformations\n",
    "- API integrations (non-LLM)\n",
    "- Workflow orchestration\n",
    "- When you need full control over the logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Use **Agents** for:\n",
    "- Chatbots and conversational AI\n",
    "- Question answering and reasoning\n",
    "- Content generation and analysis\n",
    "- When working with language models"

Merton (1968) after the Gospel of Matthew, it describes how small initial differences in status, recognition, resources, or success lead to growing disparities because benefits (funding, attention, opportunities) concentrate with the already successful. It shows up in science (well-known researchers get more credit), education (early achievers get more support), economics, and online networks (popular content gains more visibility).\n"

A model is trained on labeled or unlabeled data (supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning), then evaluated and used to predict new cases. Common uses include spam filters, recommendations, image recognition, and fraud detection. Want a simple example or a deeper dive into one type?\n",

      "🤔 Question: Explain the difference between weather and climate.\n",
      "   Answer: - Weather: The current state of the atmosphere at a specific place and time. It includes temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, clouds, etc. Example: “It’s 28°C with light rain in Tokyo at 3 PM,” or a forecast for the next 24–72 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Climate: The long-term patterns of weather in a region, described by averages and ranges over many years (usually about 30 years). It includes typical temperatures, precipitation, seasons, and how often extreme events occur. Example: “Seattle has a wet climate with mild winters and light summers,” or “the 30-year normal rainfall for this area is about 100 cm per year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Key differences:\n",
      "- Timescale: Weather is short-term (minutes to days); climate is long-term (years to decades).\n",
      "- What’s described: Weather describes current conditions; climate describes average conditions and variability over time.\n",
      "- What it tells you: Weather tells you what to wear or what to expect today; climate tells you what’s typical for a region and how that pattern might be changing.\n",
      "\n",
      "How they relate:\n",
      "- Climate sets the background pattern you expect; weather is the day-to-day variation around that pattern.\n",

    "     When the argument is a string, it will be automatically converted to Messages.\n",

    "3. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - Node: Limited to what we implement in `process()`\n",
    "   - Agent: Built-in support for conversations, tools, memory, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configuration**:\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ What You Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes vs Agents**:\n",
    "   - Nodes: Generic processing units with full control\n",
    "   - Agents: Specialized for AI/LLM interactions with built-in features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple LLM Calls**:\n",
    "   - Use `ask_llm()` utility for basic LLM interactions\n",
    "   - Good for understanding fundamentals but limited functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agent Fundamentals**:\n",
    "   - Create agents with `Agent(model_id='...')`\n",
    "   - Use message format for conversations\n",
    "   - Access results via `agent.outputs.content`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Agent Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Use `AgentConfig` to customize behavior\n",
    "   - Set system prompts for personality and instructions\n",
    "   - Use prompt templates for input formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Providers**:\n",
    "   - Easy switching between OpenAI, Bedrock, Ollama, etc.\n",
    "   - Just change `model_id` parameter\n",
    "   - EchoModel available for testing without API keys\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Practical Applications**:\n",
    "   - Q&A systems\n",
    "   - Educational tutors\n",
    "   - Customer service assistants\n",
    "   - Content generation and analysis"

    "\n",
    "✅ **Understanding Nodes vs Agents**: When to use each approach\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Simple LLM Calls**: Using `ask_llm()` for basic AI interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Agent Creation**: Building agents with different model providers\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Agent Configuration**: Using AgentConfig for customization\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Message Format**: Proper conversation handling with role-based messages\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Practical Applications**: Q&A systems, educational tutors, code reviewers\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Error Handling**: Robust agent design with input validation\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintaining context across interactions\n",
