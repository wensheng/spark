    "# Tutorial 6: Agent Configuration and Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Time:** 30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Master AgentConfig for structured agent configuration\n",
    "- Understand and implement different memory policies\n",
    "- Configure memory windows and conversation history\n",
    "- Work with preloaded messages for context initialization\n",
    "- Distinguish between agent state and memory\n",
    "- Implement stateless vs stateful agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building AI assistants for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support Bot**: Needs to remember the entire conversation to provide context-aware help\n",
    "- **FAQ Assistant**: Stateless, answers each question independently for efficiency\n",
    "- **Therapy Chatbot**: Maintains a rolling window of recent conversation to stay relevant without overwhelming the model\n",
    "- **Code Review Agent**: Preloaded with project context and coding standards\n",
    "- **Research Assistant**: Long-term memory with summarization of previous research sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these requires different **memory management strategies** and **configuration patterns**. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure agents for various memory requirements and understand the tradeoffs between different approaches."

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### AgentConfig: Centralized Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "**AgentConfig** is a Pydantic model that centralizes all agent configuration in one place:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "config = AgentConfig(\n",
    "    model=OpenAIModel(model_id='gpt-5-mini'),\n",
    "    system_prompt='You are a helpful assistant.',\n",
    "    prompt_template='User question: {{ query }}',\n",
    "    memory_config=MemoryConfig(policy=MemoryPolicyType.ROLLING_WINDOW, window=10),\n",
    "    preload_messages=[...],\n",
    "    output_mode='text',\n",
    "    tools=[...],\n",
    ")\n",
    "agent = Agent(config)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Type-safe configuration with Pydantic validation\n",
    "- Easy to serialize/deserialize for saving agent configurations\n",
    "- Clear separation between configuration and runtime behavior\n",
    "- Reusable across multiple agent instances\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory vs. State vs. GraphState: Critical Distinctions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory** (Conversation History):\n",
    "- Stores the **message history** sent to the LLM\n",
    "- Managed by `MemoryManager` via `memory_config`\n",
    "- Controls what the LLM \"sees\" from past interactions\n",
    "- Policy-driven (NULL, ROLLING_WINDOW, CUSTOM)\n",
    "- Impacts token usage and context window\n",
    "- **Agent-level scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "**State** (Node State):\n",
    "- Stores **application-level data** like counters, flags, metadata\n",
    "- Node-local, does NOT flow between nodes\n",
    "- Persists across node invocations (e.g., in loops)\n",
    "- Accessed via `context.state`\n",
    "- Does NOT affect LLM input\n",
    "- **Node-level scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GraphState** (Global Shared State):\n",
    "- **Shared across all nodes** in a graph\n",
    "- Thread-safe with automatic locking for concurrent execution\n",
    "- Accessed via `context.graph_state`\n",
    "- Enables coordination between multiple agents/nodes\n",
    "- Does NOT affect LLM input (unless explicitly passed)\n",
    "- **Graph-level scope**\n",
    "- Perfect for multi-agent workflows and global tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Memory: What the LLM sees (agent-level)\n",
    "agent.memory = [\n",
    "    {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Hello!'},\n",
    "    {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Hi! How can I help?'},\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "# State: Node-local tracking (NOT sent to LLM)\n",
    "context.state = {\n",
    "    'conversation_id': 'conv_123',\n",
    "    'user_id': 'user_456',\n",
    "    'message_count': 2,\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# GraphState: Shared across all nodes (NOT sent to LLM unless passed explicitly)\n",
    "await context.graph_state.set('total_messages', 150)\n",
    "await context.graph_state.set('active_agents', ['agent1', 'agent2'])\n",
    "counter = await context.graph_state.get('workflow_iteration', 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark provides three memory policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. NULL Policy** (Stateless)\n",
    "- No conversation history is maintained\n",
    "- Each message is processed independently\n",
    "- Most efficient for token usage\n",
    "- Best for: FAQ bots, simple Q&A, stateless APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. ROLLING_WINDOW Policy** (Bounded Memory)\n",
    "- Keeps only the last N messages\n",
    "- Automatically drops oldest messages when limit is reached\n",
    "- Balances context and token efficiency\n",
    "- Best for: Chat bots, support agents, conversational interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. CUSTOM Policy** (Advanced)\n",
    "- Use a custom callable to manage memory\n",
    "- Full control over message retention logic\n",
    "- Can implement summarization, importance scoring, etc.\n",
    "- Best for: Complex memory requirements, research assistants, adaptive agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tutorial plan mentioned a SUMMARIZE policy which would automatically summarize old messages to compress context. This is not yet implemented in Spark but can be achieved via CUSTOM policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from spark.agents.memory import MemoryConfig, MemoryPolicyType\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stateless agent (no memory)\n",
    "memory_config = MemoryConfig(policy=MemoryPolicyType.NULL)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rolling window with 10 messages\n",
    "memory_config = MemoryConfig(\n",
    "    policy=MemoryPolicyType.ROLLING_WINDOW,\n",
    "    window=10\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Custom memory management\n",
    "def custom_memory_fn(messages: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:\n",
    "    # Keep only high-priority messages\n",
    "    return [m for m in messages if m.get('priority') == 'high']\n",
    "\n",
    "memory_config = MemoryConfig(\n",

    "### Understanding Rolling Window Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. New messages are added to memory\n",
    "2. When memory exceeds window size, oldest message is removed (FIFO)\n",
    "3. Only messages in window are sent to LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Rolling Window:**\n",
    "- Conversational agents that need recent context\n",
    "- Chat bots with ongoing conversations\n",
    "- Support agents handling customer inquiries\n",
    "- Any scenario where context is needed but not entire history\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics:**\n",
    "- ✅ Maintains recent conversation context\n",
    "- ✅ Bounded token usage (predictable costs)\n",
    "- ✅ Simple to configure and understand\n",
    "- ✅ Good balance of context and efficiency\n",
    "- ❌ Loses older conversation details\n",
    "- ❌ May forget important info mentioned early\n",
    "- ⚠️ Need to tune window size for use case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing Window Size:**\n",
    "- **Small (2-4 messages)**: Quick exchanges, simple tasks\n",
    "- **Medium (6-10 messages)**: Standard conversations, most chat bots\n",
    "- **Large (12-20 messages)**: Complex discussions, support sessions\n",
    "- **Very Large (20+ messages)**: Consider CUSTOM policy with summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** Monitor your token usage and adjust window size based on:\n",
    "- Average message length\n",
    "- Model context window limits\n",
    "- Cost constraints\n",
    "- Quality of responses (bigger window = better context)"

    "- Processing independent requests\n",
    "- Building stateless APIs\n",
    "- Token efficiency is critical\n",
    "- No conversation continuity needed\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Always use AgentConfig** for new agents (cleaner, more maintainable)\n",
    "2. **Choose memory policy** based on use case, not default\n",
    "3. **Monitor token usage** and adjust window size accordingly\n",
    "4. **Use state for tracking**, memory for conversation, **GraphState for coordination**\n",
    "5. **Preload important context** to save tokens and setup time\n",
    "6. **Test memory behavior** with realistic conversation lengths\n",
    "7. **Document memory decisions** in your code\n",
    "8. **Consider custom policies** for advanced use cases\n",
    "9. **Use GraphState** when agents need to coordinate in multi-agent workflows\n",
    "10. **Always check** if `context.graph_state` is available before using it"

      "\n",
      "Common contact options\n",
      "- Website: Look for a “Contact Us” or “Support” link (usually in the footer).\n",
      "- Phone: Most companies list a support phone number with hours.\n",
      "- Email: Support or help@ or similar email address.\n",
      "- Live chat: Often available on the support page or app.\n",
      "- Help center / ticket system: Submit a support ticket with details of your issue.\n",
      "- Social media: Some brands respond via Twitter/X or Facebook messages.\n",
      "- In-app support: If you’re using a app, check Help > Contact Support or Support/Feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to have ready\n",
      "- Your account or order number (if applicable)\n",
      "- A clear description of the issue\n",
      "- Steps to reproduce the problem\n",
      "- Your device/OS and app version (if it’s a mobile app)\n",
      "- Screenshots or screen recordings (optional but helpful)\n",
      "- Any relevant error messages\n",
      "\n",
      "How to phrase a ticket or message\n",
      "- Brief summary: “Issue with [product/service] after [time/event]”\n",
      "- Details: what happened, what you expected, and what you tried\n",
      "- Attachments: include screenshots or logs if possible\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tell me the company or product you’re trying to reach, I can give you the exact contact method (phone number, email, and hours) and the best channel for your issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What about billing questions?\n",
      "A2: I don’t have memory of past questions, but I can help with general billing questions. Here’s a quick starter guide. If you tell me the specific product or service, I can tailor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Finding and downloading invoices/receipts\n",
      "  - In your account, go to Billing or Payments. You can usually view billing history and download invoices or receipts for each charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Payment methods\n",
      "  - You can add, remove, or update credit/debit cards, PayPal, or other supported methods in the Billing/Payments section. Look for an “Add payment method” or “Manage payment methods” option.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Subscriptions and plan changes\n",
      "  - Upgrades/downgrades: often apply at the next billing cycle or immediately, depending on the service.\n",
      "  - Cancellations: you can cancel or pause a subscription in the Billing area; you’ll usually retain access until the current period ends.\n",
      "  - Proration: some services prorate charges when you change plans mid-cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Taxes and billing information\n",
      "  - You can update billing address, tax IDs (e.g., VAT/GST), and country in your profile or Billing settings so invoices reflect the correct details.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Refunds and disputes\n",
      "  - Most services have a refund policy and a process to file a dispute or request a refund. Look for “Billing help,” “Refunds,” or “Contact support” in the help center.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Overages and credits\n",
      "  - If you exceed plan limits, you may incur overage charges or be prompted to upgrade. Some services offer credits or usage alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Failed payments\n",
      "  - If a payment fails, you’ll typically receive a notification. Update your payment method and try again; there can be a grace period before service is interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Security and privacy\n",
      "  - Billing data is usually protected with encryption and PCI-compliant processes. Don’t share payment details in public messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "How I can help next\n",
      "- Tell me the product or service you’re using, and describe the exact billing issue (e.g., “I can’t download an invoice,” or “I was charged twice,” or “How do I cancel?”).\n",
      "- If you can share non-sensitive details (like invoice number or date) I can guide you on where to look or what steps to take. I don’t have access to your account, but I can walk you through the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q3: What was my first question?\n",
