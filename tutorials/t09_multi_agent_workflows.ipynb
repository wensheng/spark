    "# Tutorial 9: Multi-Agent Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Time:** 60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design and implement multi-agent workflows\n",
    "- Coordinate multiple agents with GraphState\n",
    "- Route work between specialized agents\n",
    "- Aggregate results from parallel agent execution\n",
    "- Handle agent failures and fallbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Single agents are powerful, but complex tasks often require a team of specialized agents working together. Think of a software development team: you have a Product Manager defining requirements, Developers writing code, and QA Engineers testing it. No single person does it all perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to orchestrate a \"team\" of AI agents to handle complex workflows like:\n",
    "- **Research Pipeline**: Researcher -> Analyst -> Writer\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Triage -> Specialist (Technical/Billing) -> QA\n",
    "- **Panel of Experts**: Multiple experts giving diverse opinions which are then summarized\n",

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Agent Specialization\n",
    "Instead of one giant prompt doing everything, we create specialized agents with focused system prompts. This improves performance, maintainability, and debuggability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Workflow Patterns\n",
    "- **Sequential**: Agents work in a chain (Output of A -> Input of B)\n",
    "- **Parallel**: Agents work simultaneously (Fan-out), results are combined (Fan-in)\n",
    "- **Router**: A \"boss\" agent decides which specialist should handle the task\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. GraphState Coordination\n",
    "While nodes can pass data directly, **GraphState** acts as a shared whiteboard where agents can read the full context and write their contributions.\n",
    "\n"

      "A simple daily walk can do more for your health than you might expect: aiming for about 150 minutes a week (roughly 30 minutes of brisk walking most days) lowers blood pressure, improves cholesterol and cardiorespiratory fitness, and in large studies is linked to a roughly 20–30% reduction in premature death — effects driven by better endothelial function, less inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity. Walking also boosts calorie burn and muscle glucose uptake, helps control weight, lowers diabetes risk and even short post-meal strolls reduce blood sugar and improve HbA1c in people with or at risk for diabetes. On top of that, regular walking eases depression and anxiety, improves sleep and cognition, and preserves muscle strength, balance and joint mobility — reducing fall risk and supporting bone health as we age. Because it’s low-impact, inexpensive and easy to slot into everyday life, small consistent amounts of walking add up to meaningful, wide-ranging benefits.\n"
